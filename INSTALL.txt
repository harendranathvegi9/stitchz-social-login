REQUIREMENTS AND NOTES
----------------------

None.



INSTALLATION
------------

1. Download the Stitczh Social Login plugin from http://www.stitchz.net/Wordpress
   Keep track of where the file was saved as it will be needed in the following
   steps.

2. Login to Wordpress as an Administrator.

3. Go to the Wordpress Admin counsel, then click "Plugins".

4. Click "Add New".

5. On the Add New page, click "Upload".

6. Click "Browse" and navigate to where the stitchz_social_login.zip file was 
   saved to and click open.

7. Click "Install Now" to install the plugin.



CONFIGURATION
------------

Before using Stitchz Social Login, you must setup an application at: 
https://login.stitchz.net/. Once you application has been setup, continue with
the steps below.

1.  Login to your Wordpress site as an Administrator, and go to the Wordpress 
    Admin counsel.

2.  Click "Settings > Permalinks"

3.  Change the default way WordPress handles web URLs. Under "Common Settings", 
    select any option except "Default", and click "Save Changes". This will 
    modify the .htaccess rewrite rules.

4.  Next, click "Plugins".

5.  Navigate to the Stitchz Social Login plugin in the plugins list and click 
    "Activate".

6.  Then, click "Configure".

7.  Copy your App Url, ApiKey, AppSecret, and Return Url from your Stitchz
    application into the appropriate fields in the Stitchz Social Login API
    Settings form. All fields with "(required)" are, you guessed it, required.

    The "Return Url" is your Wordpress website's full web address plus the Stitchz
    Wordpress end point ('/stitchz_social_login/auth'), i.e.
    https://www.yourwebsiteaddress.com/stitchz_social_login/auth

8.  Next, select the API Version to run. The "Standard Login" option is a basic
    authentication request used to only authenticate a user. The "OAuth 2 Login"
    option sends an OAuth 2.0 authenticated request to the Stitchz API and
    returns a valid OAuth 2.0 token. The token can be used later to make authorized
    requests to Stitchz.

9.  Confirm your Stitchz Login API Settings before moving on to the next section.

10. Click the "Sync Providers" button to synchronize your provider list 
    configured in your Stitchz application with your Wordpress instance. If all 
    settings are correct a sample login will display with all your configured and
    active identity providers. Check the README.txt file if any errors occur.

11. Enable/disable any login forms where the Stitchz Social Login links are 
    displayed. By default the links are visible on all available forms.

12. The "Social Login Notes" field can contain up to 255 letters or numbers in 
    plain text and will be displayed under the social login links.

13. Click Save.
